Autofac has fairly comprehensive [documentation ](https://autofac.org)regarding its configuration so we will not attempt to recompose that. Suffice to say that once you have created a ContainerBuilder class in Autofac, you pass that into the RCommon [configuration entry point](broken-reference) with the AutofacContainerAdapter.&#x20;
