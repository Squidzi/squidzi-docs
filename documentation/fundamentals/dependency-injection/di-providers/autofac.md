# Autofac

Autofac has fairly comprehensive [documentation ](https://autofac.org)regarding its configuration so we will not attempt to recompose that. Suffice to say that once you have created a ContainerBuilder class in Autofac, you pass that into the RCommon [configuration entry point](../../configuration.md) with the AutofacContainerAdapter.&#x20;
